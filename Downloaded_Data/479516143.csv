-Please allow the StoneCutter to be used

-Please add a fourth dimension

-Please make llamas have a saddle and can be controlled

-Please make the zombie horse controllable

-Please make a mode to where you can go back to Alpha and Beta

-Please make a way to earn mine coin s without actually buying them with real money

-Please put the /crash command back

-Please make villagers be able to wield weapons and defend themselves

-Please add something similar to red stone but that acts like a real wire

-Please add more mob heads like Ender men and spiders

-Please add new vehicles not like modern ones but like wagons

It has almost everything that’s in the real world! ALMOST. I have read many other reviews, and all of them love Minecraft, except for a few things. Animals are one of them. So many people want more animals. I play on IPad and love the game, but all the updates we have had so far are all the same. Parrots. Stained Glass. Shields. Banners. And so much that already came out a year ago. I agree with all the rest of the Minecrafters who want the bugs to be fixed, More blocks and Textures, More animals and ways of transportation, More animations, E.T.C. If you read this request, please consider it and try and make it become true. 
     These are also some requests of mine and those of others : Could you add Coral Reefs and Fish that actually swim around? I would also like it if you add these :
1. Gorillas and Monkeys
2. Rideable and Tamable Birds, Dinosaurs and Dragons
3. Porgs (from Star Wars) 
4. Bears, Tigers, Lions, and more big cats and dogs
5. Make-Your-Own-Paintings
6. Different types of Birds and Dragons (My favorite Animals)
7. Wind that makes the trees move
8. Deer, Seahorses, Narwhals, Flamingos

Please put these into account. Thank you once again!

How I hate to spend the evening on my own
Autumn winds
Blowing outside the window as I look around the room
And it makes me so depressed to see the gloom

There's not a soul out there
No one to hear my prayer

Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme, gimme, gimme a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Movie stars
Find the end of the rainbow, with a fortune to win
It's so different from the world I'm living in
Tired of T.V.
I open the window and I gaze into the night
But there's nothing there to see, no one in sight

I’ve now deleted the app multiple times, cleared the cache etc and nothing has worked at all.

I put all my tools and inventory into a chest, then the game crashed. When I reloaded the game, all my stuff was deleted from the chest, and the game crashed repeatedly. 

Whenever I try and move above ground in the over world, I am met with insane amounts of framerate lag. I have minimal Redstone in my world, nothing that should warrant that much lag.

Additionally, I have had many instances where I die and the game tries to respawn me at my bed, but the game crashes and reloads with me spawned at original world spawn. All in all, some really annoying issues.

2. The chests and the issue with putting them all in at once, thank you for fixing that.
3. Can you add cross platform play for computer and PE? I have a friend who has a computer, but we can't play toghether. Please do it.
4. Last but not least (but I think this is the most important), PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE add hypixel for pocket edition. And not some rip-off like Nether Games. I want to play real bed wars so bad. It would also be nice that if you connect it to the hypixel that already exists, so it's the exact same. I get that PvP might be a little unfair (computer vs. pocket edition), but I don't care. I really want it. Please do it. When you do it, write a reply to this review showing the server name and address for hypixel. Thanks in advance.

The only things I would like them to add is maybe a paint brush and u click a certain item and u can pick its colors, example: beds, shulker box, wool, carpets, glass, and doors. The other thing is when u buy custom worlds they are super fun but take a lot of coins and right now I have 130 coins but can’t spend it on anything 😕. If u could add some other worlds or make some cheaper so people with less than 160 coins could spend it that would be amazing!!! Also could u add bearded dragons and snakes ( some more animals in general) and (like cats) could there be more styles of dogs? Other than those things Minecraft is the best game to play when u need something fun to do.

Not knowing if you created tool cool down for a specific reason, most of the community and myself would appreciate if a game rule could be implemented into the game where we could choose whether to have it off or on. Splendid would that be! Besides that big problem that interferences the game, please try to make RedStone in PE like PC. This may be difficult so don’t try to hover fixing a minor problem. I’m just trying to keep that in mind. Please fix the bug that moves the screen randomly to the sky. Last but not least, XBOX LIVE SIGNING!

I think that that would be a great improvement to the game. Finally could you improve multiplayer? I have found that if a player plays in another player's world it becomes extremely laggy. Plus getting into another player's world can be hard. One of my friends (that I use to play with often) never shows up in my friends tap.

And you make great updates like the aquatic update where you can swim and stuff like that and the seed picker is great too like I use the costal village for my survival but if you had other stuff like capes and torches that you don’t need to place like mods on pc where they have light without placing them anywhere 
It would be great for like in a cave or mining. It would be a little to realistic but it will be cool
Also can you make an app or in Minecraft a skin and cape maker in game that would be cool too
I would be happy if you made behavior packs or resource packs free😉

1. Turkeys
2. Big cats
3. Rats, Chipmunks
4. Whales (PLEASE I LOVE WHALES)
5. Goats
6. Sharks
7. Just more Marine animals I love ocean life
8. More cats like savannah cat in my opinion they are the best cat and if you add them make them like dogs because that's how they behave in life and make it taller then the other cats
9. Crocodiles/Alligators
10. More dogs
11. Alex head (that sounds so weird but you have the Steve why not add an Alex head)
12. I know you already have parrots but you don't have baby parrots I mean that would be adorable a baby parrot on your shoulder

3141435187,Disappointed,Your game is dumb,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id287470927,1.6,1,"I’m writing you yet again about your game glitches that have yet too be fixed even with this last update. Maybe I haven’t explain or complained about it enough for you to see it necessary to take the time to fix it.  Let’s start at the beginning and take it step by step so I make sure I explain it on everyone’s level of understanding so I don’t leave any of you confused or with questions. Here we go please try and keep up. When you start a new world on Minecraft everyone has the option to put in a certain seed and just below that it gives you another option of what world you would like too choose. Your options are infinite, old or a flat world. Myself I choose the old world for the following reasons. One it’s harder to get lost. Two my friends and I like to clear the whole world rebuild it and make it our own. Now I’m sure your thinking ok so why does she keep emailing us and complaining and giving us bad reviews? Here’s why!When I first choose an old world like I explained above at first it’s not an issue. I start it and it opens and I work on the world for hours with my friends. But when I get off of that world and close the game to come back later it never loads. Shows that’s it’s loading the green bar fills all the way but never loads. Doesn’t give an error message just keeps telling me stupid Minecraft stuff like where Minecon was or how nobody has see junkboys face blah blah blah. When I choose the infinite world option like I explained above it doesn’t give me any issues. Let’s me on it anytime I want and let’s my friends join. But why won’t it let me do that with the old world option? I’m sure you see the frustration. So like I’ve stated in all of my messages too you, I will continue to complain and give this game a 1 star rating until my issue is fixed. Not that anyone at this company cares but unfortunately for you I have lots of free time considering how much I used to play your Minecraft game that no longer lets me on my worlds that my friends and I have spent hours on.",0

3139522078,I can’t play this anymore..,",!!!!!!!,!!,!,!",https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id279248156,1.6,1,"So I updated the 1.6 update, and I went into my world to try the barrier block and see how it functions. Then I went to building a minute later, when I started building I crashed. I tried again and I crashed again. I don’t get it. What’s the point of an update if nobody can use it. Now I wish I never updated this app..",0
3139513581,Extraordinary!,MrsLilyR,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id7625853,1.6,5,"Best game I have ever played! I have played since there wasn’t even hunger implemented in the game yet. I play nearly everyday, usually with my Xbox Live friends. When they made it so only Xbox Live accounts could play on servers I was so sad because I used to play servers all the time, but one day I got a Xbox Live account and I was so happy that I could play on servers again and with some new friends! I really recommend this game to all, it is really fun to play and build! I usually play creative mode so I could build freely. I would rate 1,000,000 stars if I could.",0

and 2 the constant screen spasms.Basically a glitch in which i’m looking to a direction and all of a sudden i’m looking at the opposite direction or my screen just freaks out!!!So Pleeeeeease!!! i’m begging you mojang fix the glitch.!!!!I mean this is especially frustrating when you are building something amazing trying not to mess up when all of a sudden you break everything everywhere because your screen just went crazy!!!!...Other than that you can’t begin to imagine how much i love this game!!!",0
