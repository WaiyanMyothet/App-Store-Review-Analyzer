3186798884,Please fix these!!!,Silverleafa,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id577995513,1.39.93,4,"I really like the idea of being able to customize your farm. Like your house, roadside shop, and the truck, and all. I love decorating my farm! But I am not liking how expensive it is... very disappointed. 😓😢😭😫😞
I love this game and been playing for a long time now. I would totally give 5 stars again if we can do something about the cost of the customize farm. I would like to be able to do more, especially when you don’t have the money to put into the game. (for coins and diamonds) 
                   Please and thank you! 🙏🏼🐮🙏🏼🐔

Also I have know test that sometime  when I go to guys something in the side road shops the Islam’s I buy dose not get purchased even though someone dose else dose not buys it. 
I have seen on Facebook hay day groups that this is a big problem that a lot of people are having! Please help! And fix this!!!",0

My mom and I have this thing where I’ll  give her stuff to sell for full price.She’ll then, buy it and when I need it she will sell it to me for a $1. When I was trying to do that to upgrade my barn and silo, we did that very thing. When I tapped on it so I could buy it, it let me but when I went to go upgrade them it said I didn’t have those items. That sucked because my mom then had no idea where they went. We tried it again even after I logged out completely. Nothing. She then told me to write a complaint and da da da da da. I sincerely hope you fix this since I love hay day.",0

3160804220,Absolutely perfect,Camillegwinn,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id428194291,1.39.93,5,"One thing I must say that is outstanding is that they don’t shove prices in your face! I’ve played tons of other games that make the game impossible without buying something. For example, Cooking Fever. It’s pretty much impossible to go on with that game without buying diamonds. But, this game just keeps you wanting to play. Another thing is that the times are also perfect (for making things). At first I thought some of the times were too long, but you NEED these times! If they weren’t there, everything would be shoved in your face and it would be SO overwhelming! While you’re waiting for your sugarcane to grow, you can scour the newspaper! It’s not like Sims Freeplay, where you just have to wait and wait forever for one single thing and can’t play on, no, there’s millions of opportunities for this game. Best game in the AppStore!",0

3154562972,Resetting the game,Hayesgrierismylife,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id283767475,1.39.93,4,This game is fun and all but I messed up and wasted a ton of money and gems and wanted to restart but there’s no option to restart. I deleted it and downloaded it again and it says that I still have a game in my cloud that I can’t get rid of because apple deleted the Game Center app. So I have the option to pick between the current game or the cloud game but every time I pick my new game it makes me pick again every time I open the app. It gets redundant and annoying. I just wish there was a simple “RESET GAME” button. Is that too much to ask?? I also googled it and no one seems to know how to do it either.,0

I just feel like if i pay diamonds for Tom to be able to get me stuff he should be able to get building supplies to upgrade or stuff to expand land, Especially since they are hard to come by and they take up barn storage which is precious since there is so much to upgrade and more once you get the town.

The reason why is because when you are asking people for help in derby & nobody is playing at that current time you leave the game to do other activities and then when you come back 30 minuets later somebody in your group has tried to help you & you missed what they put in their item shop or revivals & then someone else gets what you needed. This is a huge flaw especially when you want to win the derby.

3037101826,Pretty addicting,Chinesepurson,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id118702145,1.39.93,3,"I have been playing this game for years, and I still love it. I love how there is sooo much to do. You’re never bored! There are a few features that I feel should be added/improved for a smoother game. 
1) During a derby, players should be able to call “dibs” on tasks that they plan to do next. This would be helpful so that other players don’t take the task or trash the task. 

2) When inviting people to be part of your neighborhood, I think players should be able to do just that. Rather than having to add the person as a friend first, and then send the invite; that would make things smoother and one less step to take. 

3) Having a “tool shed” would be great! Sometimes players are “saving up” their tools so that they can expand storage in their barn/silo or expand their farm/town/fishing areas, but that takes up a lot of barn storage. I think that this addition would be most appreciated by all players. 

Those three are my only suggestions. I hope the game developers take them into consideration!",0

3001287198,Just AMAZING!!!!!!!!!,SophiaGAsh,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id486888544,1.39.93,4,"Hay Day is such an amazing (and totally addictive) game that my friends and I play for hours and hours at once! So far I’ve reached the 30’s in levels and although it did take me a while to get there, (even with non-stop playing), I just can’t put phone down! In the game, you level up and receive different types of rewards based on levels. You can grow new plants, have new animals, and get new decorations for your one and only farm. The currency in the game is mostly coins, but as most games have, you can buy special games with rare diamonds. At first I didn’t understand how there could be new unlocks at the level 400 like I’ve seen people upgrade to, but then it turns into more than just a farm! You can make clothes, sushi, pasta, sauces, jams, juices, cakes, pies, the list goes on and on! All of this on one tiny app! My favorite game of all time. One thing I do NOT like about the game is the in app purchasing. Being a totally addicted Hay Day player, I can’t help but buy extra coins or diamonds with in app purchases! BUT... whenever I buy something, I wait for my reward to come, but it doesn’t. It always says that an error has occurred or something. And even worse, I don’t even get my money back! Although the game is amazing and super fun, I think that this absolutely brings my rating from a 5 star to a 4 star. Hay Day team, if you’re reading this, PLEASE get it checked out!

Saludos desde Puerto Rico.

Deseaba sugerir q por favor permitan vender ya sea en el mercado o en la granja misma todos los artículos q hemos recibido por ejemplo los de adorno q no nos gustan o no necesitamos aunque sea por un valor mínimo . 
Se guardan tantos y no se utilizan, mas se ha ido cambiando la decoración q se pueden considerar hasta obsoletos . O también q se puedan intercambiar por diamantes, tiques, piezas del rompecabezas, herramientas  o por los permisos de ampliación q muchas veces se hace difícil conseguirlos .

Me encantaría q consideraran mi petición pues llevo ya más de 4 años en el juego y aunque por un tiempo lo dejé , retorne pero se me hace difícil pasar de nivel y poder continuar ampliando y re-decorando mi granja y el pueblo. 

Gracias por la atención .

Atentamente;

I waited on Hay Day for 1 pack of nails to upgrade my silo for a whole week. I get it, it’s just a game right? Well, the game gave me every other thing it can give, but no nails. When watching videos for tools/supplies I was even shown nails as the prize I was watching for, but no nails. Finally, I got nails & upgraded my silo only to find my new silo is too small. Now I’ve been waiting for 3 packs of nails for a week & a half. Oh yeah, every time I harvest I get reminded my silo needs upgraded & I can’t do much else until I do. The game has no problem telling me I can spend diamonds to do anything I want, yet diamonds, as we all know, are the money maker for Supercell. This game is a lesson in greed capitalizing on impatience. Patience gets penalized. Just like in life. People are starting to get tired of greed & corruption with their cellphone apps, services, & providers. Apps come & go. Hope Supercell survives. I’m deleting Hay Day & never coming back.

You never get enough money to maintain the farm.  I think it was devised by farmers to let you understand why farms are always failing and cannot meet their daily demands.

I loved the game, played w family/friends, but with their new super cell ID they must be having glitches.  They kicked my co-leader out of her level 76 farm, demanding a super cell ID to get back in.  She never set one up, doesn’t want one.  However, now it won’t let her set one up. So she’s lost her entire game and after a week of me on the game support trying to be a go between, we are back to them telling me that once she logs back into her game they can help her.  She can’t log in at all, not even to a level 1 farm, but they don’t seem to accept that.   They don’t apparently have any sort of escalation teams who can take unique situations and work to resolve without reading off screens the same tired advice they keep giving.  I’m to a level 97, almost 98 but intend to delete my game.

*changed it to four stars to show that it’s not completely perfect. Wish there was a four and a half but oh well.

GLITCHES:
1. House Glitch 
Yes, I see that tiny little glitch. Whenever you touch the mansion/house to see the achievements, the house resets to the first one for a brief moment. Slight, but still an error.

The glitch disappeared recently once I reached level 20, so either it’s gone forever or it only happens to houses under level 20.

PREFERENCE PROBLEMS:
1. Production Buildings
- Can you change the graphics of the production buildings so that they can fit to the proportions of the human beings in the game? It just bugs me that my good neighbor, Greg, can fit in my BBQ. 

2. Decorations
- It sort of bothers me how the price raises each time you buy one more thing, till you basically become broke. Could you please fix that so that it remains at a fixed price? 

- Also, the decorations need a little resizing too. I find it alarming that the flowers are almost as tall as Greg.

- Can you add more decorations that attract the decor animals (the birds, the frogs, the foxes, the butterflies)?

3. Roadside Shop
- I think that it’d be nice if, like in the ad, the roadside shop displays at least some things when the user sells stuff instead of just having empty wooden boxes.

4. Scrolling
- Can you please allow us to scroll more around the corners? Whenever I place stuff there, I can’t fully see it and it bugs me.
5. Mr. Tom the Errand Boy
- can you please let him do other stuff during his resting time/unhired time besides sleeping? I’m becoming terribly envious that he gets more than 14 hours of sleep a day.

For example, just let him... play with the foxes that sometimes come on the side of the road, or read a book or something. Please just something besides sleeping! 

6. River Boat Crates
For certain items such as cheesecake, it’s ridiculous how much time it takes to make certain amounts of it. It makes it hard because if there were six orders of cheesecake, it would take 16 hours, and there’s also people that need to go to sleep. Also, it takes a long time for other people to help, even if you ask for it. 

Maybe shorten the cheesecake timer?

PRAISE:
First of all, I love the tiny details everywhere: the foxes, the frogs, the fish, the butterflies, and the birds. It’s super cool, and it just tides me over while I wait for a task to finish.
Second of all, I love how appetizing the food looks. I probably shouldn’t, but they all look really, really good. I also really like the chat. It’s so convenient, so I’d like to give an extra thanks for adding that. You know what, no one really needs to know what I like. But thanks for adding all of those details that make this game special!",0

-Having the option to use coins to hire Tom and neighbors (Rose and Ernest).

I know that the editors can get busy but some of the reviews on here have good ideas. I know that mine would help all players in the game, and that others would appreciate them so much. So again, here are some things I think should be added to the game. 

1) A machine that after a certain amount of hours, or once a day, provides you with a helpful expansion/upgrading/mine item, and only these items. The item can be random, or we could have the option to pay money to up the chances of getting a certain item. We would not need axes and saws if you were to add number three below to the game.

2) We have all had this problem, preparing to fill a fellow farmers boat order only to discover we don't have the correct amount of items. On every players farm there should be a donation box where we can leave the items we have in exchange for XP. They can then take them and add them to the amount they already have and finish filling their boats. We both get XP out of it, so no one feels cheated.

3) I used to play another farming game before I found HayDay. On that game we were not required to cut down our fruit trees or bushes. Instead we had to water them if we wanted them to produce anything. This should be the same for HayDay. We should have to water our plants if we want them to produce anything instead of cutting them down and buying new ones and we would have a limit on the amount of trees and bushes we could have. Ten of each type for example. In order to water them we should have to put a well or rain catcher on our farm that refills daily. Once it is empty you can't water anymore. However we can have other players water our plants for us, similar to how they revive our plants now after they have died. To make it more challenging sometimes you can have events where there are small droughts and our water catchers/wells don't fill up for a while so all of our fruits are more valuable. We should also be able to move the well/rain catcher whenever/wherever we want. If you do update the game and we are not required to cut down trees anymore then we should be able to move the trees around freely.

These are the three biggest things I want added to the game, and I'm sure others would enjoy these additions as well! Please take these into consideration and try to add them into the game. It would make it a little easier on the players who don't spend real money on the game. Other than that, j LOVE this game! I have been playing for a couple years on and off and just am amazed with it! Haven't found a game that comes even close to this! 

Thank you :)",0

2918440927,Obsession and expensive,Slns7552,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id31579415,1.39.93,2,Hay Day is addictive and you can become obsessed with it. But it can be expensive. It is hard to build up vouchers and diamonds without investing a lot of time and money buying them. Then some of the crops are hard to come by and sometimes require diamonds to get one or two plots of them (which isn’t enough to fulfill the orders). Some items take all day to produce. I’ve also noticed that vegetables disappear from the silo.  For example I harvested 10 plots of rice the other day and it registered in the silo. When I went to use them they were gone.,0

When I try to sell items 10x for 1 coin to my neighborhood clan other people who are not in my neighborhood come and take the items before my friends have a chance, I've even tried not putting an ad into the newspaper but somehow someone always comes to my shop and takes those items. What I think should be done is the shop has two separate sections inside: one section for everyone else and the other one for neighborhood friends cause if I want to sell something to my friends I should be able to do it, not have some random people come over and buy. 
When I put something in my shop 10x for 1 coin other people think it’s a sale so they buy it, also when I restock the shop I’ve noticed that people stay at my shop and keeps buying everything, I would leave the game and come back on when some of my friends want something and as soon as I put it in the shop it’s bought by the same people before I got off the game.

It’s extremely fun for the lower levels, but also shows some love to the higher leveled players. I’ve been playing for 4 years and it truly never gets tiring. Those worried about “pay to play” or “pick up then drop” type games, you won’t have o worry about that with hayday. Hayday makes it relatively easy to upgrade & function your farm. Those who don’t want to spend money will do just fine without, but it really makes buying in app purchases so much worth it. Which is good for kids due t the fact you can pass without paying, but for the older folks who would like to invest money it’s great. Even if you do invest money you don’t really end up spending too much. And if your anything like most people, you don’t get tired of this game. Many users have been playing for YEARS. this isn’t a game where you start to get bored, or you run out of things to do. It truly is an amazing game and the community is beautiful. Whether you want to play alone or with others this game really suits your interests. It’s also pretty customizable, most features you can choose not to do, and it won’t affect your gameplay too much. This game has a lot goin for it , and considering how young it is (only 6 years old) it’s amazing what these creators did. Everything in it is just so beautifully put together and detailed.

Also, there are many buildings that only have about 4-6 products. Hello? Why is that when there are more obvious products. Take the jam maker for example. Why isn’t there any grape jam? Another is the candle maker. There are only three types of candles, and there are more fruity scents that it could use. This goes for almost every production building.

If you don’t have enough storage you have to sell stuff but what if you have no more space and you already used your ingredients to make like pie,eggs and bacon, bread ect.

For example, an expansion materials newspaper or sales/deals newspaper or animal food newspaper, fruits, etc. there should also be the ability to write a note to farms you visit. Also, we should have a Tom maybe Becca but instead of diamonds we get her for a couple days with a lot of coins. In addition there should legitimately be a building for things you will let others trade you with. Also, there should be couple houses and stores for you to have visitors who will pay you with coins for staying there. We should also be able to send gifts to our friends.

1.  It would be awesome if there were an expandable list of the farm’s (or town’s) production buildings where you could see what is currently in a building queue, as well as add items into the building queues without collecting the items that have already been produced.
2.  In the roadside shop, it would be awesome if there were a way you could enter the desired price you want to sell the item/s for to eliminate scrolling up or down with the current controls.
3.  Town visitors’ waiting time is way too long, and discourages me from game play in the town.  It would be awesome if these times were shortened to make gameplay more enjoyable.",0

Naming my animals is what I have always wanted in Hay Day and I’m so happy! I was wondering if maybe these few things could be added: naming sheep, cows, pigs, goats, bees, and chickens would be awesome! I already have a few names in mind,     Naming the visiting frogs, birds, butterflies, and foxes would be incredible too, because I have so many ponds, flowers, and bird houses and the creature visit extremely often, maybe make it that the animals are like pets and don’t leave and are nameable,       Changing the color of pets like you can change the color of building or maybe pet outfits and choosing if your pet was a male or female would be probably one of the best updates! Also maybe adding more sanctuary animals and pets like Siamese cats, huskies, German shepherds, Clydesdale horses, llamas, spotted bunny for pets and maybe zebras, wildebeest, warthog, meerkat, gazelle, and rhino for sanctuary animals and if your ok with carnivores lion, cheetah, jackal, hyena, crocodile maybe the carnivores could eat bacon or something? Also could you please lower the outrageous price in vouchers for pets and make it able to trade vouchers.

Thanks for fixing the issue, I honestly wasn't expecting it to be for a long time. If you're reading to see whether or not to download it, you should.

I used to play Hay Day a couple of years back, and I've recently re-downloaded it. It was just as great as I remembered. The animals were adorable, growing crops was cool, and the newspaper system has to be one of the best mechanics in the game. It's just really fun and surprisingly accurate to online-shopping. Plus, it's way more satisfying to me to sell stuff to actual players than NPC's or to some store. I played until I reached about level 12, then I stopped playing for a couple of hours. When I  came back, """"Connection failed. Check again."""" popped up. This has nothing to do with my device or the internet that I'm using. Every game I had that required internet to function was fine, it's just Hay Day. It's been doing the same thing no matter how many times I log in, and I haven't been able to check on my farm for a while now. 

There are a couple of other things, too.
-That thing that pops up to display the town, derby, farm helpers (basically all those things on the side) always pop up blank the first time for me. Don't know if other people have this problem.
-Little girl NPC who's kinda creepy.
-The roadside shop has a limited amount of slots for products. You can buy more with gems or by befriending people. Just adding a bunch of people to your friend list was super effective and efficient 'cause you would have loads of extra slots. Now you need to friend people on Facebook to get the extra slots.

I hope by the next update this thing is fixed, because this is just a really addicting and satisfying game. 🐣👍",0

**The last update with the naming of the animals is a bit annoying.

But as I’m tapping on the animals, the screen pulls away from my intended point of view, I try to tap on something else so I’m not pulled away too far from collecting the other resting animals, however, as I’m tapping, I tap on other surrounding items on my farm and several times have tapped to spend xxx diamonds or redeem expansion permits! Stuff I’ve been saving for a long time. But I’m tapping so quickly as I’m getting pulled away as a result of tapping on animals and the screen following them, it just a hassle and annoying and could be updated to remove the screen following of the animals, it’s unnecessary in my opinion.

Hay Day is social and not isolated from other people, so it helps make friends. I love the little parts that make you do things to keep you playing, like the truck delivery, boat, derby, and town. The only thing I’d change is having one more food mill available so there is three.

It would be great if there was a way to load or fulfill as you go. For example, if my boat order needs 3 blue sweaters and I have 2, it would be cool if I could load those 2 while I make the third. That way I don’t accidentally use them on a different order, and if I need to request help, I can request 1 sweater.

It’s a cool task goal game. It gets more complicated as you get into the high levels, which is good because it’s always challenging. The updates have all been great, however...

The naming of pets. It’s a cool concept and I like the option, but when you click on the animal, the screen locks on to them and it takes a bit to break that lock. A few clicks away and you have to zoom out to try and get out of that. In the process, other things get clicked. I’ve harvested and bought land all without wanting to, while dealing with the pets. Is there anyway to change pets names once a week or something? So it doesn’t keep giving you the edit name anytime you click on then to get the points.

Anyway, if that makes sense. Thanks!",0

Most game developers have ‘fixed’ this issue by requiring confirmation before spending. Tom requires a double tap confirmation- how hard would it be to do the same for machine products when you don’t have all required supplies?? If they fix it, I’ll fix my review to be a 5!",0

I recently got the new update and I really enjoy getting to name my pets and seeing what others named theirs. I think it would also be cool if we could name foxes and frogs on our property. Maybe there each fox could have statistics of which farms it has been on and if it was caught there.
Also, Ernest and Rose are great, but it would be useful if Rose fed the animals too.

Some days I’m obsessed and constantly harvesting crops, completing boats, doing truck deliveries, making sure my machines are always working, fishing, helping my town, and then other days I think about, do I really want to work this hard? It takes hours for things to craft and milk/goat cheese and sugar are something I run out of quickly and takes forever to make. Almost everything requires milk. I wish the game provided more duct tape and marker stakes because I’ll have like 40 out of 28 bolts or planks and like 5 out of 28 duct tape.

Aside from the family play-time, I personally love this game because it takes down my stress level after a hard day. The animals never get sick, the sun always shines, there is always a market to go to so I can get what I need for my farm, and if it's not in the """"moospaper"""", I can ask my neighbors to donate what I need! Endless fun - that's Hay Day!",0

2766475183,Enjoy Hay day but This is my seventh writing- no results,22Libra,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id34860495,1.38.187,5,"Please allow for the purchase of two or more sugar mills for the farm. So many items require sugar and one is constantly at a shortage of sugar. Many have requested this change,but you have not listened. Personally, that would be better than the other costly additions.
These are my concerns:
Having crates that require two of the same items/ingredients to filled.
Changing the items when the boat arrives after I have started working on the original order.
You need to consider shortening the amount of time to make items.h
Making it easier to locate items from the newspaper for the roadside sales
Adding the ability to purchase another sugar mill.
Hayday adds all of the other new items, train, town, etc, but you won't upgrade the simple request from players to help with farm production.
Shortening the time that Tom helps to locate items to buy.
Providing more opportunities/items to purchase more land to raise crops.
Set the computer program to assist the player's farms with upgrading and achieving levels.
Making it easier to help other players when they need help with crates.
Adding more expensive statues and items to place on the farm that are for decoration and do not help with farm production.

Please make time to review comments/feedback from your players on blogs/suggestions. I know there are """"many"""" others who have expressed concerns and act on the feedback instead of just merely taking it under consideration and giving polite curt evasive replies.",0

I love how you are in complete control of your things and you can decide what to do with them down to the minute. Sure, theres a good amount of waiting involved but that's probably one of the reasons why I didn't burn out so quickly! There's always fun things you can do, and as you level up you unlock more production buildings and activities.

2761591121,Sometimes it will screw you!,Sniper ryan,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id325426463,1.38.187,4,"I normally love this game!  I’ve been playing this game about 3 years now.  It’s a nice and relaxing app.  But I do have problems from time to time.  The first time I got on the app today, it says I have to wait 5 hours to request help on an item from my neighbors.  I haven’t been on this app since last night.  So I should be able to use it.  Then when I went into my town, I tapped on my personal train to go to other towns to pick up customers.  It says I have to wait 6 hours!  I haven’t used it since last night either.  So why is this game cheating me out of uses of the game???  I buy a small amount of diamonds every other week.  One time it had charged me twice because I purchased the diamonds and it never showed that I had any diamonds.  So I did it again.  It then double charged for the one set of diamonds.  Also, the Hay Day people have set it up to easily use your diamonds if you aren’t careful!  I have my settings set to have to “double tap” to use my diamonds.  There have been several times the game has taken my diamonds away when I accidentally tapped it ONCE or my finger brushed up on the diamond use.  So they will cheat you out of your diamonds that you have given them money for.  I usually don’t write reviews but I feel like I need to warn people about their ways if cheating you.",1
