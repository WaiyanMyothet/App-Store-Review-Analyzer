2823203375,Lost street,Nuuish,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id153674250,3.1.610,1,Played religiously with my friend until she randomly lost her street. Apparently this is a common issue? Support tried to help her but eventually gave up and said the issue is on her end. Lame customer service. Kinda butthurt cause I already put money into the game. Maybe they don’t care about old games. How is this game 5 years old and there’s still a bug that deletes your game progress??,1

It’s way different then other games like this. I love how a construction worker or the bird in the flying machine will come and speed up time on things. Some things i don’t like is how long it takes for tulips to pop up, especially blue ones. There is a lot of requests for blue dye! Also, I think it would be cool if vehicles came from both directions so it would feel more like a street.",0

But the customer support is what bears mention.  Sure, you can spend money and buy things but this is, for all intents and purposes, a free application.

I read all these reviews thinking I absolutely have to get this. It sounds like my kind of game. But once I got it, after a little while I struggled with the quests. There’s a lot of demand for Flooz for me. I love this game so much that I consider paying real money so that I can just skip getting the wanted resources for quests.  I can’t get through much without them, because it takes me forever to figure out when to use what in order to get this certain resource. I’m sure it’s just me. I’m not a patient person so don’t take this review like it just means it’s a terrible game. I just don’t like waiting a long time to get my quests done when gaming.

It’s fun and easy to play. The characters are really cute. Building and creating your street is addictive. You can build without having to spend money if you’re patient and consistent in playing. The tech support has been wonderful for me to work with. I’ve had issues in the past that they’ve helped me with. My most recent issue was changing from Android to iOS. I emailed the tech support and within 24 hrs they contacted me and helped me transfer all of my data so I didn’t loose all of my work that I accomplished on my street. I highly recommend this game.

I love the updates and the new buildings/houses to buy, but I really wish the creators would add new storylines with tasks to complete. PLEASE!!!",0

The characters, the humor and even the buildings have so much character and individuality compared to other games of this genre. What I mean is I'll compare a game in HappyStreet's genre to a separate game. This game is Farm Story. In Farm story after you've planted your crops you have to wait. However in HappyStreet things move much faster. So the game keeps a player playing for hours on end. A problem with most games in it's genre is that once you've planted your seed or built your buildings you have to wait. However in HappyStreet you can help your villagers and earn coins. These quest are very simple and don't actually show up in the quest box but it's a great way to be entertained if you waiting for a meeting or just wanna sit down and play. The list of the kinds of these minor quest go on and on. Overall absolutely recommend this game to anyone.",10

Recently I had to reset my iPad due to touchscreen issues, and lost the game. When I reinstalled it and downloaded my saved data, my last building upgrade and a new building were gone. I emailed customer service, and they rolled my data back to an even older save (which didn't make any sense), so I lost even more buildings... two entire neighborhoods worth I worked hard to get. On top of that, now customer service won't respond to email and ignores me. I sadly decided to quit and just delete the game, which is a shame too, since I payed actual money a few times for in game purchases, and lost out a bit. I will stick with Sims FreePlay and Pet Buddies, where the customer service is stellar when you have a game issue, and the data saves are more reliable. Happy Street's customer service could care less. They lost out on future money from me.",2

1572651227,I❤️GodziLab,Sierra Bullock,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id307964070,3.1.400,5,"I love this game! I have tons of games on my phone but this is by far my favorite. But I have a few suggestions. First of all, missions especially expensive ones deserve more than one flooz. Also characters like Pepin, Rufus, and Pyrce should have a temporary home. Just got the time your completing their mission. Especially Pepin since he is a permanent resident. Also you should be able to dress up the main characters like Dahlia, Billy, and Zoe in regular clothes not just their own special ones. Also you should be able to dress up Pepin. Also there have been a few minor bugs I don't know if you did this on purpose or if this was not supposed to happen, but I can't get more than 999 wood, and since I have the wood farm that gives me 50 flooz every half hour I know if I'm in lower than 999 it will go over 1000 but then delete my wood once I get back to the game. Although I really do love the game there are a few things that should be fixed. 

Thank You!

1528224141,Like Animal Crossing!,ShrimpAlmighty,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id221958067,3.1.400,5,I was looking for a game that was similar to Animal Crossing and after a week of playing this game I can say that it's a perfect fit for my iPhone. It does have pay to win features by buying flooz to speed things up however you can watch an ad in exchange for them. I just sit and watch tv while playing ads so it actually works out great. I love all the little quests and I keep getting surprised as the game opens up more and more as you do them. I'm greatly looking forward to what else this game has in store and I would absolutely recommend this game if you are interested in building your own town.,0

I went through a lot of games like that and I dropped all of them after a day or two because they just felt bland or had a major paywall. I looked over happy street several times expecting it to be just like the rest but when I finally tried it, boy was I wrong :). It's a very polished game with no crashes or issues (at least for me), the game has a cast of likable   characters with their own distinct personalities that I was not expecting from a free game. It's also very fun to see the way in which the main cast interact with one another and the jokes and gags that's are bound to happen when they do during or at the end of quest. You could easily play the entire game free of charge as none of the quest require cash to complete and on top of that if you're a person who doesn't like to spend money on app games and you see buildings you want but have to pay for don't worry you could easily stock up on floor by watching advertisement and get those buildings in a few days or less depending on how often you watch those ads the longest ad being 30 seconds long and some ads just being a picture that you can exit out of and get free floor.",0

I look under menu for achievements and NOTHING is listed. But I know I've achieved more than nothing. 
Updated review: lowered my rating. Still trying to get moonstones BUT it is has been almost impossible because the full moon does not appear that will provide moonstones. If this prolongs I am gonna delete this app. Just a waste of time. 
Game is okay but can get tedious at first then it picks up if you're patient. The ads are annoying and gets in the way of gameplay if you tap it by accident. It does not show you or give you hints on how to accomplish the tasks. One quest is to use the fertilizer and I have one BUT WHEN I look in the storage it is not there. I had to make it again. Furthermore, I have a quest that is taking almost a week to complete because the full moon never shows up! Although I enjoy this game it is becoming repetitious. game needs enhancements to explore out more.

I wish there was a way to invite Game Center friends. I tried and there is no invite option in Game Center under this game. Please fix!",0

Well, Happy Street is almost digital perfection! The graphics are well created and colorful, unlike some flimsily designed apps; the storyline is cheesy yet cute; the characters are adorable and it's not devastatingly hard to earn money, which is awesome. It's incredibly fun to find combos, fish, open bday gifts, complete goals and hold fiestas. This app is just effortless fun. It also doesn't require wifi, so it's great to play on the go.

When completing tasks for Billy, Pepin, Nyok or Zoe... Not only do some of them take up to 24 hours to complete but the rewards for completing such tasks are really not worth it. In order to level up you need (x amount of)  Stars . I happen to be on level 18, working on my way to 19 . But in order to level up I need almost 1000 stars. To get those stars, I need to restock the businesses I built in the game only earning me THREE stars for one FULLY upgraded business. Not only does it take forever to earn all of those stars to complete a level but you don't even get a single star for all the stupid tasks all the characters ask you to do all day, everyday. And on top of all that.... upgrading a business can take up to 20 hours. How am I supposed to earn stars when I spend 90% of the game waiting for things to upgrade !!?

An actual video game for a console costs $35-$60, yet you have to spend *well over* $100 just to buy enough Flooz to make this game continually fun. Without the Flooz, it loses it fun-ness quickly because you can't do much. You can earn a few Flooz here and there, but never enough to expand at a pace that would make it a fun game. It's pretty ridiculous.",0

They say that the prehistoric set is """"new"""" but I got it last year. Plus the game crashes randomly and it relies WAY too much on Facebook. I don't have a Facebook so I cannot level up the modern house, and there isn't a point in getting the Eiffel Tower or the museum for that same reason. Please add new material.

I was intrigued after hearing there was a bird that pooped on villagers. After my iPod got reset, I gave up on it. 
However, recently I've downloaded this game again, and all I can say is I'm in love with it again. I grow levels very quickly considering it takes a lot xp. points to level where I'm at! You'd imagine it'd take forever considering the only way to gain experience is to restock your stores, and with level three stores this takes longer. Anyways- enough ranting on levels. This game is beautifully designed. The colors are appealing, the humor with Zoë and Billy (and even Pepin and Nyok sometimes) is great, it's very easy to get currency in the game (I'm looking at you, TeamLava), and all in all its just great. After this update, my game doesn't crash anymore. My little brother gets a big laugh out of the dinosaurs that pass his village 😂.  

Now STOP reading these reviews and download this amazing game!

The only problem I had with it is that I DONT have a Facebook account. Some things in the game require Facebook.   Besides that I would rate this game 5/5.,0

They want you to buy stuff to speed it up of course. It is really fun though. It kind of reminds me of sim city but with fun quirky animals.",0
