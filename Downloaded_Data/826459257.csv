One thing is that the guy on the skateboard BARELY makes it through that little hole. Another thing is that I am a girl and I like designs. I wish you could change the background when you would like to. It is also super fast and I like playing games in the car but I get headaches from staring at things so if you could change the speed, it would be nice.

First of all you can't even fit through the gap in the wall because of the top half of the wall. My opinion is you would have better ratings than you have.

However, when you play flappy bird after playing jumpy jack, flappy bird seems to have slowed down. Another downside to this game is that the jack is a little too big, but that makes it more challenging and fun. I like how you jump rather than fly.

The only problem so far is that the advertisements are in the way of where you tap so you end up tapping the advertisement mid game and get redirected or the skater doesn't jump. Please add an option to remove in game advertisement by purchasing or at least a way to move the advertisement in a different place. When this is done the game will truly be worthy of 5 stars. Also more boards to unlock would be cool and a setting to select what accessories you want to equip your skater with

953209237,Not Working,Random iPhone User123,https://itunes.apple.com/us/reviews/id184462442,1.0,5,"I recently downloaded the app, and then opened it. When I did, I went to the start screen. I attempted to hold my finger down on my iPhone, like the app suggested, but it didn't work and the app closed. I tried this a few times, and nothing worked, I then deleted the app.
I would assume that this is a rare issue, and mostly likely a bug. I personally feel that I cannot unfairly rate an app due to it not working correctly, because then I do not get to experience what the creator of this game originally intended,
And it would be unfair to give a 1 star rating to an app that I never got to use.
I rated this app 5 stars because I feel that I would have enjoyed this app, if I would have been able to use it.

I'm not comfortable yet with where to tap on the screen to make Jack jump high or low, but I managed to do good enough to grab that 1st t-shirt. It's pretty good overall. It's a definite time waster if your sitting around with nothing to do. You can easily spend a lot of time on this game b/c the more you keep crashing the more you'll want to play until you start making some progress.",0
